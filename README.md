# What
This extension adds a tiny button on the top left of the Pixiv Fanbox (maybe some other websites in the future). You can click on it to gather all the images from one post as a zip file.

# Why
I've been tired with saving those beloved images one by one and the other extension I found doesn't work for me.

# How
Some JavaScript magic.

# Where
Load this extesion on about:debugging page because I don't want to publish it.

# Disclaimer
This extension only grabs images that the user is able to view, i.e. you still need to be a member of the creator in order to unlock limited contents.
